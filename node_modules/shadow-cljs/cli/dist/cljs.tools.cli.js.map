Multiple pairs\n                  of validation functions and error messages may be provided.\n\n    :validate-fn  A vector of functions that receives the parsed option value\n                  and returns a falsy value or throws an exception when the\n                  value is invalid. The validations are tried in the given\n                  order.\n\n    :validate-msg A vector of error messages corresponding to :validate-fn\n                  that will be added to the :errors vector on validation\n                  failure.\n\n  parse-opts returns a map with four entries:\n\n    {:options     The options map, keyed by :id, mapped to the parsed value\n     :arguments   A vector of unprocessed arguments\n     :summary     A string containing a minimal options summary\n     :errors      A possible vector of error message strings generated during\n                  parsing; nil when no errors exist}\n\n  A few function options may be specified to influence the behavior of\n  parse-opts:\n\n    :in-order     Stop option processing at the first unknown argument. Useful\n                  for building programs with subcommands that have their own\n                  option specs.\n\n    :no-defaults  Only include option values specified in arguments and do not\n                  include any default values in the resulting options map.\n                  Useful for parsing options from multiple sources; i.e. from a\n                  config file and from the command line.\n\n    :strict       Parse required arguments strictly: if a required argument value\n                  matches any other option, it is considered to be missing (and\n                  you have a parse error).\n\n    :summary-fn   A function that receives the sequence of compiled option specs\n                  (documented at #'clojure.tools.cli/compile-option-specs), and\n                  returns a custom option summary string.\n  \"\n  [args option-specs & options]\n  (let [{:keys [in-order no-defaults strict summary-fn]} (apply hash-map options)\n        specs (compile-option-specs option-specs)\n        req (required-arguments specs)\n        [tokens rest-args] (tokenize-args req args :in-order in-order)\n        [opts errors] (parse-option-tokens specs tokens\n                                           :no-defaults no-defaults :strict strict)]\n    {:options opts\n     :arguments rest-args\n     :summary ((or summary-fn summarize) specs)\n     :errors (when (seq errors) errors)}))\n"]}
